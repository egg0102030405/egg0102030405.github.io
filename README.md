# Toolkit: Calorie recognition

Introducing our innovative Toolkit mobile app design, a convenient way to track your dietary habits and make healthier choices. Through our app, you can photograph your meals to estimate calorie intake, maintain a daily and weekly record, manage your diet plan, and personalize your profile according to your body measurements. With its user-friendly interface, the app comprises five tabs: Record, Everyday, Category, Plan, and Profile.

1. **Record:**

The Record tab is the central feature of our Toolkit app. After clicking the Record option, you are prompted with "Take photos to keep track of your diet." Below, there's a button to open the camera and capture your meal, followed by a confirmation button. Once confirmed, the app will display identified food items and quantities.

For more accurate results, you can use the "Add More" button to include unrecognized food items. Each identified food item is coupled with an "Edit" button allowing modifications or deletions for any misidentified item.


3. **Modify record information:**

Upon clicking "Add More," you'll enter a keyboard input interface. The app will automatically generate "Category:" and "Serving Size:", allowing you to specify the type and quantity of the food. Once entered, hit return to include this information in your record.


4. **Everyday:**

The Everyday tab presents a comprehensive overview of your daily food intake. It visually represents your recorded meals, their respective categories, and the total calorie count for the day. It compares your daily intake with your average and displays each meal's recorded time and snapshot.


5. **Weekly Overview:**

By selecting the Record tab and scrolling down, you'll access a weekly intake chart. This section displays a bar graph representing your calorie consumption over the week, daily calorie intake, count of meals recorded, and personalized advice based on your daily calorie intake.


6. **Plan:**

Clicking on the Plan tab brings you to a To-Do List interface. Here, you can add, remove, or check off dietary goals. Based on your personal body weight and height data, this tab also provides a recommended daily calorie intake.
